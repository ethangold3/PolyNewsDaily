    "\n",
    "1. Insight Value (0-10):\n",
    "   - Does it reveal non-obvious implications using prediction market data?\n",
    "   - Does it connect market probabilities to real-world implications?\n",
    "   - Does it go beyond surface-level news reporting?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Information Quality (0-10):\n",
    "   - Is the information specific and actionable?\n",
    "   - Are market probabilities clearly connected to conclusions?\n",
    "   - Does it avoid vague or generic statements?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Professionalism & Tone (0-10):\n",
    "   - Is the content respectful and professional?\n",
    "   - Does it maintain appropriate formality when discussing serious topics?\n",
    "   - Does it avoid sensationalism while remaining engaging?\n",

    "Headline: \"Market Signals 75% Chance of Fed Rate Pause Through Q2\"\n",
    "Subheader: \"Traders Betting Heavily on Extended Hold Pattern Despite Recent Inflation Data\"\n",
    "Blurb: \"While mainstream coverage focuses on the latest CPI print, Polymarket's fed-futures contract reveals traders are increasingly confident about an extended rate pause. The 75% probability suggests markets have largely priced in stabilizing inflation, despite mixed economic signals. This diverges from traditional analyst forecasts, which remain split on the Fed's next move. For investors, this implies potential opportunities in rate-sensitive sectors that may be mispriced based on mainstream narratives.\"\n",

    "SCORE 5 EXAMPLE:\n",
    "Headline: \"Ukraine Aid Package Shows 60% Chance of Passage\"\n",
    "Subheader: \"Market Odds Reflect Congressional Uncertainty\"\n",
    "Blurb: \"Polymarket traders are giving the latest Ukraine aid package a 60% chance of passing this month.

The market has fluctuated between 55-65% over the past week, suggesting no clear direction yet.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis:\n",
    "- Insight Value: 4/10 - Mostly restates known information\n",

    "- Insight Value: 0/10 - No specific insights or analysis\n",

    "   - Does it go beyond surface-level news reporting?\n",

    "   - Is it revealing information that otherwise wouldnt be clear? If it is on a topic in the news with uncertainty, the market could be a big help.\n",
    "   - Are market probabilities clearly connected to conclusions?\n",
    "   - Does it avoid vague or generic statements?\n",

The 75% probability suggests markets have largely priced in stabilizing inflation, despite mixed economic signals. This diverges from traditional analyst forecasts, which remain split on the Fed's next move. For investors, this implies potential opportunities in rate-sensitive sectors that may be mispriced based on mainstream narratives.\"\n",

[...] Another one of the sources said the idea of gifting Trump this specific plane has been under discussion for “quite some time” and that when the formal offer was made more recently, the president “happily accepted.”\\n\\nABC News\\xa0first reported\\xa0the gift.\\n\\nIn response to questions about Qatar giving the plane to Trump, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said gifts from foreign governments are accepted following the law. [...] ABC News reported that Attorney General Pam Bondi and other DOJ lawyers had determined that the acceptance of the plane was legally permissible if the Qatari government gifts it to the Defense Department and it is later turned over to the Trump Library Foundation.\\n\\nA former senior DOJ official who spoke on condition of anonymity said that for the jet gift to violate federal laws barring the payment of bribes or gratuities to officials, the gift would have to be motivated by corrupt intent.\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/trump-set-accept-luxury-747-qatar-use-air-force-one-abc-news-says-2025-05-11/\"/>\\nThe luxury plane, which would be one of the most valuable gifts ever received by the U.S. government, would eventually be donated to Trump\\'s\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/05/12/nx-s1-5395696/qatar-trump-plane-gift-ethics\"/>\\nTrump said Monday that the plane isn\\'t a gift to him, but to the Department of Defense. He added that it will be decommissioned after his term for his presidential library, and that he will not use it after leaving office.\\n\\nRichard Briffault, a Columbia Law School professor who specializes in government ethics, says that distinction doesn\\'t matter: If the plane goes to Trump\\'s presidential library after he leaves office, \"then it\\'s not really a gift to the United States at all.\" [...] The Boeing 747 plane — which industry groups say could be worth around $400 million — would be one of the biggest foreign gifts ever received by the U.S. government. That\\'s controversial because the Constitution\\'s Foreign Emoluments Clause forbids public office holders from accepting a present \"of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.\" [...] While not yet finalized, the Trump administration\\'s plan to accept a luxury plane from the Qatari government to serve as Air Force One has already drawn fierce criticism from Democratic lawmakers and independent watchdogs who say such a move violates the Constitution.\\n\\nThe White House confirmed on Sunday that Qatar had offered to donate a plane to the Department of Defense, but that it will not be presented or accepted during President Trump\\'s visit to the Middle East this week.\\n</Document>']\n"

The White House and Qatari government have confirmed the offer, but as of the latest reporting, the formal transfer has not yet occurred.

The probability of the market resolving 'Yes' is notable (15.5%), suggesting significant uncertainty remains, likely due to the deal's legal, ethical, and procedural complexities and the lack of finalization as of mid-May 2025.\"}\n"

[...] Pentagon officials in an earlier memo defended the ban, saying that “the medical, surgical, and mental health constraints on individuals who have a current diagnosis or history of, or exhibit symptoms consistent with, gender dysphoria are incompatible with the high mental and physical standards necessary for military service.”\\nThe new Pentagon policy would allow for limited exemptions. [...] The\\xa0Supreme Court\\xa0ruled that the administration could enforce the\\xa0ban on transgender people in the military, while other legal challenges proceed. The court’s three liberal justices said they would have kept the policy on hold.\\nNeither the justices in the majority or dissent explained their votes, which is not uncommon in emergency appeals.\\nWhen the initial Pentagon directive came out earlier this year, it gave service members 30 days to self-identify. Since then, about 1,000 have done so.\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/26/politics/pentagon-remove-transgender-service-members-new-policy\"/>\\nThe Pentagon’s new policy is far stricter than the policy under the first Trump administration’s ban, which allowed troops who had joined before the policy took effect to be grandfathered in and continue serving. The policy made public on Wednesday directed that service members being separated will be considered non-deployable until they are removed from service. It also says no funds from the Defense Department will be used for any surgical procedures relating to “sex reassignment surgery, [...] “Service members who have a current diagnosis or history of, or exhibit symptoms consistent with, gender dysphoria will be processed for separation from military service,” says a memo outlining the policy, which was signed by the official performing the duties of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness. The memo was included in a court filing as part of an ongoing lawsuit over the Pentagon’s policy. [...] The policy guidance follows an executive order signed by President Donald Trump in January directing the Pentagon to implement its own policies that say transgender service members are incompatible with military service. It’s unclear how many transgender individuals serve in the military; in 2018, an independent research institute estimated there were 14,000 transgender troops serving.\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document href=\"https://san.com/cc/military-leaders-begin-screening-service-members-for-gender-dysphoria/\"/>\\nStraight Arrow News\\n\\nMilitary leaders begin screening service members for gender dysphoria\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nPolicy enforcement\\n\\nThe Pentagon is enforcing a Trump-era ban that disqualifies service members with gender dysphoria from continued military service.

The rest of the field sees rapidly diminishing probabilities, with several countries (such as Belgium, Czechia, Australia, Ireland, Cyprus, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Serbia, Slovenia, Montenegro, Croatia) already at 0%, suggesting effective elimination or near certainty of not reaching the top 5. Internet sources confirm Sweden’s strong position, as it led the OGAE fan poll with a significant margin, and Austria is also highly regarded in fan and expert circles. The Eurovision scoring system is a hybrid of national jury and televote points, with 'Big Five' countries (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, UK) and the host automatically qualifying for the final. This increases the certainty for these countries to at least compete for top spots. Jury independence is emphasized, but international context and performance factors (vocals, staging, originality) play a key role. The market is dynamic, with notable recent increases in France and Austria's probabilities, and a dip for the Netherlands and Israel. Fan polls and national selection outcomes in 2025 align closely with the market frontrunners. The contest’s format—with semi-finals and a grand final—means some countries are at risk of elimination before the top 5 can be determined, which is reflected in market pricing.\"}\n"

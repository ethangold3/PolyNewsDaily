    "\n",
    "1. Insight Value (0-10):\n",
    "   - Does it reveal non-obvious implications using prediction market data?\n",
    "   - Does it connect market probabilities to real-world implications?\n",
    "   - Does it go beyond surface-level news reporting?\n",
    "   - Is it on an interesting topic? (Sports scores are not interesting. They should get low scores except for occurances where it is beyond predicting a matchup's outcome)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Information Quality (0-10):\n",
    "   - Is the information specific and actionable?\n",
    "   - Are market probabilities clearly connected to conclusions?\n",
    "   - Does it avoid vague or generic statements?\n",
    "   - If it is predicting something at near 100 percent certainty, then it is not that interesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Professionalism & Tone (0-10):\n",
    "   - Is the content respectful and professional?\n",
    "   - Does it maintain appropriate formality when discussing serious topics?\n",
    "   - Does it avoid sensationalism while remaining engaging?\n",

    "Headline: \"Market Signals 75% Chance of Fed Rate Pause Through Q2\"\n",
    "Subheader: \"Traders Betting Heavily on Extended Hold Pattern Despite Recent Inflation Data\"\n",
    "Blurb: \"While mainstream coverage focuses on the latest CPI print, Polymarket's fed-futures contract reveals traders are increasingly confident about an extended rate pause. The 75% probability suggests markets have largely priced in stabilizing inflation, despite mixed economic signals. This diverges from traditional analyst forecasts, which remain split on the Fed's next move. For investors, this implies potential opportunities in rate-sensitive sectors that may be mispriced based on mainstream narratives.\"\n",

    "Analysis:\n",
    "- Insight Value: 10/10 - Combines market data with practical investment implications\n",

    "SCORE 5 EXAMPLE:\n",
    "Headline: \"Ukraine Aid Package Shows 60% Chance of Passage\"\n",
    "Subheader: \"Market Odds Reflect Congressional Uncertainty\"\n",
    "Blurb: \"Polymarket traders are giving the latest Ukraine aid package a 60% chance of passing this month.

The latent anger felt by many Americans at the healthcare system - a dizzying array of providers, for profit and not-for-profit companies, insurance giants, and government programmes - burst into the open following the apparent targeted killing of Thompson in New York City on Wednesday. Thompson was the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, the insurance unit of health services provider UnitedHealth Group. \"We find high rates of people saying that their healthcare costs are unaffordable, across all insurance types, even (government-funded) Medicaid and Medicare,\" she said. A survey by researchers at health policy foundation KFF found that around two-thirds of Americans said insurance companies deserve \"a lot\" of blame for high healthcare costs.\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/amyfeldman/2024/12/05/unitedhealthcare-denies-more-claims-than-other-insurers---angering-patients-and-health-systems/\"/>\\nThe bullet casings from the ammunition that killed UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson reportedly had three words written on them: “Deny”, “Defend” and “Depose.” These words allude to the strategy that some attorneys and critics have used to describe the tactics used by health insurance companies to deny making payment on claims — and the most recent available data suggests that UHC is perhaps the country’s worst offender. Delays and denials from UHC also frustrated its relationship with Duke Health, whose CEO said in an interview earlier this year that the insurer “has been 57% slower to pay claims than our other payers and takes over 60 days to respond to claims they deny.”\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document href=\"https://apnews.com/article/unitedhealthcare-delay-deny-depose-insurance-online-criticism-2d9c9a1a2a551876e72a11a93fc7624c\"/>\\nMany are venting insurance frustrations after UnitedHealthcare CEO\\'s shooting | AP News AP Top 25 Election 2024 Results Trump transition AP VoteCast AP Race Call Explainers Explaining 2024 En Español AP Top 25 AP Top 25 NFL NBA NHL Men’s College Basketball Women’s College Basketball MLB Auto Racing Movie Reviews What to Stream Television Book Reviews Music Celebrity Interviews 2024 Holiday gift guide Food & Recipes Gardening Homes Travel Fashion Pets More From AP News This week’s fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson has unleashed a wave of public feeling — exasperation, anger, resentment, helplessness — from Americans sharing personal stories of interactions with insurance companies, often seen as faceless corporate giants.

    "\n",
    "1. Insight Value (0-10):\n",
    "   - Does it reveal non-obvious implications using prediction market data?\n",
    "   - Does it connect market probabilities to real-world implications?\n",
    "   - Does it go beyond surface-level news reporting?\n",
    "   - Is it on an interesting topic? (Sports scores are not interesting. They should get low scores except for occurances where it is beyond predicting a matchup's outcome). Juicy pop culture surprises can be pretty interesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Information Quality (0-10):\n",
    "   - Is the information specific and actionable?\n",
    "   - Is it revealing information that otherwise wouldnt be clear? If it is on a topic in the news with uncertainty, the market could be a big help.\n",
    "   - Are market probabilities clearly connected to conclusions?\n",
    "   - Does it avoid vague or generic statements?\n",
    "   - If it is predicting something at near 100 percent certainty, then it is not that interesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Professionalism & Tone (0-10):\n",

    "Blurb: \"While mainstream coverage focuses on the latest CPI print, Polymarket's fed-futures contract reveals traders are increasingly confident about an extended rate pause. The 75% probability suggests markets have largely priced in stabilizing inflation, despite mixed economic signals. This diverges from traditional analyst forecasts, which remain split on the Fed's next move. For investors, this implies potential opportunities in rate-sensitive sectors that may be mispriced based on mainstream narratives.\"\n",

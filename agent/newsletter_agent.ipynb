The 75% probability suggests markets have largely priced in stabilizing inflation, despite mixed economic signals.

Iran on Tuesday launched a two-wave ballistic missile attack in response to Israel’s killing of Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut last week and following the July 31 assassination of Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. Marc Owen Jones, an analyst at Northwestern University in Qatar, told Al Jazeera that while Iran’s attack was carefully calibrated to avoid any escalation, Israel’s response is “unpredictable.” Since the damage from the attack was minimal, Israel could opt for a limited response as it did in April, when Iran launched its first-ever attack on Israeli territory.\n",

Iran launched a salvo of about 200 ballistic missiles at Israeli military targets, its largest ever such attack, sending sirens blaring across Israel and activating the country’s sophisticated defensive systems. Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said Tuesday’s missile strikes focused on Israeli security and military targets and was in response to Israel’s killing of Nasrallah and other commanders, including Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in the Iranian capital Tehran in July.

      "Both Vice President Kamala Harris and Former President Donald Trump are in discussions to appear on the top-ranked “Joe Rogan Experience” podcast in the waning days of the presidential campaign, according to reports, as both try to broaden their appeal to young men, though Rogan has made withering remarks about them. The “Joe Rogan Experience” has never hosted Trump on the podcast, and Rogan has been outspoken about the candidate, calling Trump a “polarizing figure” and “existential threat to democracy,” although Rogan — a staunch defender of free speech — has also defended Trump supporters and criticized the internet’s portrayal of Trump. Comedian Theo Von — who hosted Trump several weeks ago on his podcast — held a two-hour-long episode with billionaire Mark Cuban, who discussed his support of Harris.\n",
